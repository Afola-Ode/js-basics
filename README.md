##### Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
In statically typed languages, the type of a variable is known at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime. Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, and Haskell. In these languages, the programmer must specify the data type of a variable when declaring it and must use explicit type conversions when necessary. The benefit of this is that it can catch type errors early in the development process, making it easier to maintain and debug the code.

In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime, and the same variable can refer to values of different types during the execution of the program. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. In these languages, variables can be dynamically assigned and re-assigned to different values, and type checking is performed at runtime. The advantage of this is that it allows for greater flexibility and faster development, but it also makes it harder to catch type errors, as they may only become apparent at runtime.

##### Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined`
In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are both values used to represent the absence of a value.
`undefined` is a value that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
`null` is a value that represents an intentional non-value. In other words, it is a value that you can explicitly assign to a variable to represent the absence of any other value.
`undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, while `null` is a value that you can assign to a variable to represent the absence of any other value.

##### In the ‘js-basics’ folder you created above, create a file and name it ‘index.js’. Inside the file, Write a function that multiples two numbers. Call that function to multiply any two numbers of your choice and log the answer in your console
